# Notion Task Management Clone

A Rust project inspired by Notion's task management system, built with a focus on:

- **Rust** for the backend logic
- **PostgreSQL** as the database
- **Nginx** for reverse proxy and load balancing
- **Clean Architecture** to ensure maintainability and scalability
- **JWT Authentication** for secure access
- **Access Control** to manage roles and permissions
- **Refresh Token** mechanism for token renewal and session management
## Getting Started

    docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d --build
```
